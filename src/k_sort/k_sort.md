## range
square root (number of elements) * 1,4

## sorted index function
create function that sorts numbers and applies the index that they have when sorted to the struct


## function to make k shaped stack_b
while (stack_a)
{
	if (s.index <= i)
		pb, rb
	else if (s.index < i + range)
		pb
	else
		ra
	i++
}

## how to push back into stack_a
- push the biggest index to stack_a
- calculate how to rotate to the biggest index with lowest cost (ra rra)
